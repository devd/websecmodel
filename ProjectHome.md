### Overview ###

We implement a formal model of web security based on an abstraction of
the web platform and use this model to analyze the security of
several sample web mechanisms and applications.
The project is currently implemented in Alloy v4.

### Coverage ###

The current implementation defines web principals, and models browser behaviors including same origin policy, cookies, and redirects.

The case studies we have undertaken include HTML5 forms, Referer validation,  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), and a single sign-on protocol.
